# Air-Pollution-Exposure-Forecast-Dashboard
Built an end-to-end air pollution forecasting dashboard using LightGBM with synthetic data to improve model performance. The system predicts pollutant levels and computes a Personal Exposure Index (PEI) based on lifestyle factors like outdoor time and activity, enabling personalized pollution risk assessment beyond city-level indicators.
